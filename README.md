# icsEventsToMermaidGannt
A simple parser for .ics files (exported from Outlook) that turns them into plaintext in the format recognized by MermaidJS's Gannt charts.

# Roadmap
- [ ] Upload a few different formats of .ics files into `examples` directory
- [ ] Decide on icalendar parsing dependency (or write my own), and document its installation
- [ ] Itemize components of output format
- [ ] List how to export the day's events out of Outlook (with pictures) > Low priority
